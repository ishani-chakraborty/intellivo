# Intellivo 

## Introduction

Intellivo is a web application built with the Flask framework. The app facilitates an intellectual conversation between two users by providing starter questions in the chat room. Our matching algorithm intelligently matches users based on differences, similar to the idea behind a dating-app. 

## Why Intellivo?

While important intellectual conversations have been happening on social media platforms, the problem is that these difficult discussions tends to happen over social media, where we have platforms such as Instagram composed of friends and other like-minded individuals whose beliefs and values tend to align with their own. Intellivo works to elimintate the creation of this echo chamber by providing a safe place to both better educate ourselves and understand the origins of various perspectives.
